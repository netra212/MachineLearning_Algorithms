# Eigen Vectors:
A.V_vector = Lambda. V_vector
- Special vector, because direction of the vector does not change or span of the vector does not change. 
- Direction of vector does not change occurs applying linear transformation. 

Note:- Largest Eigen Vectors of the covariance matrix always points into the direction of the largest variance of the data, and magnitude of this vectors equals the corresponding eigen values. 

#. Step by Step Solution:-
    1. mean center the data. 
    2. calculate the co-variance matrix. 
    3. find the eigen vectors and eigne values. 

# How to transform points ?
