# This is the feature extraction techniques. 
# Point to Remember: This is not the feature selection technique. 

# features -> dimensional. 
# f_n < f_m
# Curse of Dimensionality:
-> It says that whenever we add the more and more features, the accuracy of the model get increased but there is a point where a accuracy of the model start to decrease so we have select the optimal number of features.
