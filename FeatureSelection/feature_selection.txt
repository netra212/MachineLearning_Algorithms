# What is feature selection ?
-> Features = input columns.

# Why do we need feature selection ?
1. Curse of Dimensionality. 
2. Computational Complexity. 
3. Interpretability.

# Filter Based Feature Selection ?
- Filter-based feature selection techniques are methods that use statistical measures to score each feature independently, and then select a subset of features based on these scores. These methods are called "filter" methods because they essentially filter out the features that do not meet some criterion.
