# Why ML Problems are a statistical Inference Problem ?
Question Understanding: With the help of sample, we try to find the estimate value for the value <-- this is called statistical inference problem.
Ans:- lpa = f`(cgpa, iq) + reducible_error + irreducible_error

# Most Important Question.
Q. Why Regression Analysis is required ? or Inference Vs Predictions ?

## Inference: Study of the relationships between LPA --> (CGPA, IQ).
    -> Either LPA has a mathematical relationships with (CGPA, or IQ) or not. 
    -> Also, what is the relationships of LPA with CGPA & LPA with IQ. ?

    Examples:- 
    
    Ads Advertisment dataset. 
        
        TV   Internet   Newspaper   Sales
        Internet relationships with Sales
        Newspaper relationships with Sales

## Prediction: 
# For the feature selection, we use the inference.
