Linear Regression
- supervised ml algorithms used for predicting a continous numerical value based on one or more input features. 
- It assumes a linear relationships between the inputs variables (independent) and output variables (dependent).

# Assumptions of Linear Regression:
- Linearity between features and output.
- Independence of errors.
- Homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors).
- No multicollinearity (in multiple regression).
- Errors are normally distributed.
