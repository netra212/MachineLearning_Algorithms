#. Clustering:
1. Partition Clustering. 
-> Also,called centroids based clustering. 
-> Example:- Kmeans clustering. 

2. Hierarichial Clustering. 
-> 

3. Density Based Clustering. 
-> Example:- DBSCAN.

4. Distribution based (model).
-> Based on the distribution of the datasets. 
-> Example:- Gaussian Mixture Model.

5. Graph based Clustering. 
-> In this clustering, image each data points like an graphs. 
-> Example:- Spectral Clustering. 

6. Soft Clustering Vs Hard Clustering. 
-> Examples:- Fuzzy Cmeans Clustering.
