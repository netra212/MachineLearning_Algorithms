# KNN
The K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm is a simple, non-parametric machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is based on the assumption that similar items are close to each other in a feature space. KNN works by finding the k-nearest neighbors to a given query point, and predicting the class or value of the query point based on the classes or values of its neighbors.

# What is the K Nearest Neighbor Algorithm?

# Definition of KNN

- The KNN algorithm is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning. It involves storing all available cases and classifying new cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). The basic idea of KNN is to find the k-nearest neighbors to a given query point and use their class labels (in the case of classification) or their values (in the case of regression) to make a prediction for the query point.

# How it works ?
- KNN works in three main steps: 

    (1) calculating the distance between the query point and each training point, 
    (2) selecting the k-nearest neighbors to the query point, and 
    (3) predicting the class or value of the query point based on the majority class or the mean value of the neighbors, respectively. 
    
    The choice of the distance metric and the value of k are important parameters in the KNN algorithm.


- There are many different distance metrics you can choose from, with the most common being Euclidean distance. Other possible distance metrics include Manhattan distance, Minkowski distance, Hamming distance, and Cosine distance. These distance metrics define the decision boundaries for the corresponding partitions of data. The “right” distance metric to choose depends on the problem at hand. 

- With respect to choosing the appropriate value of k, this will largely depend on the input dataset. 
- The k value determines the number of data points that the algorithm considers when predicting the value/label of a new data point. 
- A larger value of k considers more data points, resulting in a smoother decision boundary, but may lead to underfitting. 
- A smaller value of k considers fewer data points, resulting in a more complex decision boundary and may lead to overfitting.


# Applications:
1. Image Classification:
- The KNN algorithm can be used in image classification tasks by representing each image as a feature vector and then applyig the KNN algorithm to the set of feature vectors.
- One common approach is to use the pixel values of an image as the features. For example, an RGB image with dimensions 100×100 pixels can be represented as a feature vector of length 30,000 (100x100x3), where each element of the vector corresponds to the pixel value of the corresponding RGB channel.
- Once the feature vectors are extracted from the images, the KNN algorithm can be used to classify new images by finding the k nearest neighbors of the new image’s feature vector in the training set and assigning the new image to the majority class among its neighbors.
- However, using pixel values as features can result in high-dimensional feature vectors that are computationally expensive to process. To address this issue, techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors and extract more meaningful features that can improve the accuracy of the KNN algorithm.
